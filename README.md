# Gaia_CharacterCreator

It's an application to help player create their character for the ttrpg "Gaia - Le Dernier Mythe" ("Gaia - The Last Mythe").
It's a french game, not (yet?) available to the public. There's, for now, no plan to translate it to english or any other
language.

It's a personnal project, to train myself and learn new things. I'm not sure if I ever finish it, considerinf the game itself
is still in development and in constant changes. If you want to use this code to create your own character creator, or take
inspiration for any of your project, feel free to do it!
